While he has worked as a sound guy for the film, TV, and music industries, it was in public radio where he found his calling. Matt worked as Associate Producer for the highly acclaimed national music show <em>UnderCurrents</em> for ten years while contributing to other nationally broadcast public radio shows including, but not limited to, <em>Latino USA</em>, <em>A World of Possibilities</em><em>, </em>and <em>The Brian Lehrer Show</em>. In 2015, he became the Interim Technical Director for <em>Studio 360 with Kurt Andersen,</em> which took his sound design skills to a new level. He is also a creative and performing member of the <em>Harvestworks </em>international art collective, which combines contemporary digital tools and performing techniques with traditional and nontraditional instrumentation.</p>
